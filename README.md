# minesweeper

Another nostalgic clone.

# TODO

- Touch interface (hold finger for marker)
- End of game overlay + sounds
- Highscores (local)
- Randomize via a seed
- Animated popping with sounds (including double click)
- Highscores (online): score + seed
- Bug: when you left click on a mine, and immediately right click, the wrong tile is shown
- Bug: you can still click on a marker, and activate the mine
- New game options
- Bug: interface doesn't fit on small preset
