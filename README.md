# minesweeper

Another nostalgic clone.

# TODO

- Time and mine counters (retro counter)
- New game options
- Touch interface (hold finger for marker)
- Highscore
- Randomize via a seed
- Sounds
- Animated popping with sounds (including double click)
- Bug: when you left click on a mine, and immediately right click, the wrong tile is shown
- Bug: you can still click on a marker, and activate the mine
